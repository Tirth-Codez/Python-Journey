# Problem: Concatenate Two Tuples
# Given two tuples, combine them into a single tuple and print the result.

# ðŸ§  Approach:
# - Define two tuples with any number of elements.
# - Use the `+` operator to concatenate them.
# - The result is a new tuple containing all elements from both tuples in order.
# - Print the resulting tuple.

tp1 = (1,2,3)
tp2 = (4,5,6)
tp3 = tp1+tp2
print(tp3)
