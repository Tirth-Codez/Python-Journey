# ðŸ“Œ Problem: Company Management System
# Design a system to manage employees in a company using OOP concepts.
# - Create a base class `Employee` with attributes: `name`, `emp_id`, and `salary`.
# - Add methods to:
#     - Display employee details.
#     - Update employee salary.
# - Create subclasses:
#     - `Manager` â†’ has `department` and method `assign_task(employee, task)`.
#     - `Developer` â†’ has `programming_language` and method `complete_task(task)`.
# - Create a `Company` class that maintains a list of employees with methods:
#     - `add_employee(employee)`
#     - `remove_employee(employee)`
#     - `assign_task(manager, employee, task)`
#     - `show_all_employees()`

# ðŸ§  Approach:
# - Use **inheritance** so `Manager` and `Developer` can reuse attributes/methods from `Employee`.
# - Add extra attributes (`department`, `programming_language`) in subclasses.
# - Implement task assignment by having `Manager.assign_task()` assign tasks to employees,
#   and `Developer.complete_task()` mark them as done.
# - Use a `Company` class with a list to store all employees, and methods to add/remove/manage them.
# - Override `__str__` in `Employee` to print employee details cleanly when listing.

# Base Class: Employee

# Example Usage
# -----------------------------
c1 = Company()  # Create a company object

# Create a Manager and a Developer
m1 = Manager("Aarav", 201, 90000, "IT")
d1 = Developer("Tirth", 123, 56000, "Python")

# Add them to the company
c1.add_employee(m1)
c1.add_employee(d1)

# Show all employees
c1.show_all_employees()

# Assign and complete tasks
c1.assign_task(m1, d1, "Develop new feature")
d1.complete_task("Develop new feature")
