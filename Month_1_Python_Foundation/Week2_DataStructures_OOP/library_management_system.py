# ðŸ“Œ Problem: Library Management System
# Build a system to manage books and members in a library using OOP concepts.
# - Create a class `Book` with attributes: `title`, `author`, and `isbn`.
# - Create a class `Member` with attributes: `name`, `member_id`, and a list of `borrowed_books`.
# - Add methods in `Member`:
#     - `borrow_book(book)` â†’ allows borrowing if within the limit.
#     - `return_book(book)` â†’ removes book from borrowed list.
# - Create subclasses `StudentMember` (limit = 3 books) and `TeacherMember` (limit = 5 books).
# - Create a class `Library` with a collection of books and methods:
#     - `add_book(book)`
#     - `remove_book(book)`
#     - `lend_book(member, book)`
#     - `accept_return(member, book)`
# - Ensure borrowing rules are respected (students = 3, teachers = 5).

# ðŸ§  Approach:
# - Define a `Book` class to represent each book with `title`, `author`, and `isbn`.
# - Define a `Member` base class that tracks borrowed books and has methods
#   for borrowing and returning.
# - Use inheritance to create `StudentMember` and `TeacherMember` classes
#   with different borrowing limits by overriding the `borrow_book` method.
# - Define a `Library` class to store books and handle adding, removing,
#   lending, and accepting returns.
# - Use method calls like `member.borrow_book(book)` and `member.return_book(book)`
#   to enforce borrowing/return rules, while the `Library` manages the central collection.
